        About Me
      </h2>
      <img src="assets/images/img2.jpg" alt="picture">

      <p>I am originally from Italy. I have lived there for 17 years until I move to Los Angeles, California, where I currently live. I am currently a sophomore at Dartmouth majoring in CS and Math with a strong quantitative background and software programming.</p>
      <p>During the last two years, I have taken courses where I solved wide ranging computational problems using different algorithms while improving my programming skills. In the Software Design & Implementation course, I have completed team projects that comprised of a large software system – among those a search engine and a custom game server with application that connected to a pebble watch . These systems usually comprised of multi-layer sockets and thread modules while ensuring maximum efficiency.</p>
      <p>Outside of class, I run DartDrom Rentals as a managing partner. We are the largest bed and futon provider on campus, and the one with the largest revenues. running DartDorm Rentals as a managing partner taught me how to quickly think on the spot and make firm business decisions based on rigorous analysis. I frequently communicate with our customers to maintain our high customer service standards, and manage inventory maintenance as well as move-in/out logistics. Beyond daily operational tasks, I work with my partners to develop future growth efforts through marketing campaigns, market research, and brokering new deals to finance new inventory.
      </p>
      <p>During my free time, I like to travel. For me, travelling is not only a time to explore different cultures and places, but also a time for growth and self-exploration. Above is a picure of me in the Arabian desert.</p>

            <p id="con1">Written in C, the Tiny Search Engine replicates a web search engine and is comprised of three components: Web Crawler, Page Indexer, and Querier. Web Crawler is a standalone program that crawls the web and retrieves webpages starting from a “seed” URL. Page Indexer is a program that builds an index from a directory created by Web Crawler. Querier is standalone program that reads the index file produced by the Page Indexer, and page files produced by the Querier, and answers search queries submitted via stdin.</p>

The project is divided into three components. The Field Agent runs on a Pebble watch, and it constantly sends and updates its location to the Game Server and the Guide Agent, sends messages to the Game Server whenever an object was claimed, and displays messages whenever a Guide Agent</p>
